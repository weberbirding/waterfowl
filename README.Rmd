The waterfowl package is aimed at simplifying functions and workflows for waterfowl
biologist and graduate students. Ultimately, its function are simple wrappers 
around functions from other packages, but with more automation and with a preferred
output. Looking to do some habitat selection analyses with tracking data? Simply
use landcover_points() to generate a table of land cover classes for each 
location, or use landcover_percent() to generate a GLMM-ready table of 
land cover percentages for a given home range or area. No need to fuss with all the
intermediate steps; the waterfowl package will do that for you! Suggestions
for additions or changes to the package are more than welcome!

The waterfowl package is a work in progress!

## Installation

You can install the development version of waterfowl from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("weberbirding/waterfowl")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(waterfowl)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
